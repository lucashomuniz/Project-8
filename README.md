# ✅ CONCLUSION

Exploratory Analysis: All answers from the first stage of questions are present within the algorithm in Language R.

Statistical Analysis: Question 1.
A relevant piece of information that stands out in the analyzed data is that children aged between 0 and 1 year old are the ones who attend the hospital the most. This data underscores the importance of understanding hospitalization costs in this specific age group and identifying the main factors that contribute to these costs. The frequent need for medical care for children in this age group can be attributed to several reasons, such as the early development of the immune system, greater susceptibility to diseases and specific medical conditions related to the neonatal period. In addition, parents or guardians may be more likely to seek hospital care to ensure the health and well-being of their young children.

Question 2: Data analysis reveals that children aged between 0 and 1 year are responsible for the highest expenses in the hospital environment. This fact emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors that influence these costs and seeking efficient strategies to deal with the specific health demands of this age group. Detailed knowledge about spending patterns on these hospitalizations will allow hospitals to direct resources and implement adequate preventive measures, aiming to provide quality care and minimize the financial impact on families and the health system as a whole.

Question 3: When analyzing the data, it is observed that the refined diagnosis group 640 is responsible for the highest total expenditure in the context of hospital admissions. This information underscores the need to understand the factors that contribute to the costs associated with this specific group of patients. Deepening the analysis in this group will allow identifying the main medical conditions, treatments and services involved, enabling the implementation of targeted strategies to optimize resources, improve the quality of care and seek more efficient solutions in terms of cost-benefit.

Question 4: To investigate the relationship between the patient's race and the total cost of hospitalization, we will perform an ANOVA test. The dependent variable will be the total cost (TOTCHG) and the independent variable will be the race (Race). The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no effect of race on total spending, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that there is an effect. After the analysis, we get a p-value greater than 0.05, which causes us to fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0). Therefore, we conclude that patient race does not have a significant influence on total hospital stay expenditure, based on available data.

Question 5: To analyze the influence of age (AGE) and gender (FEMALE) on hospital costs (TOTCHG), we will use an ANOVA test. The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no effect of age and gender on hospital costs, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that there is a significant effect. After the analysis, we obtain a p-value less than 0.05, which leads us to reject the null hypothesis. We conclude, therefore, that there is a significant effect of age and gender on hospital costs. This indicates that both patient age and gender have a statistically significant influence on hospitalization costs, based on the analyzed data. This information is essential to better understand the factors that affect hospital costs and can provide valuable insights for decision-making and the efficient management of financial resources in a healthcare context.

Question 6: To investigate the relationship between the length of stay (LOS) and the independent variables (AGE, FEMALE and RACE), we will use a Linear Regression model. The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that there is a linear relationship. When performing the analysis, we observed that the p-value is greater than 0.05 in all cases, indicating that we failed to reject the null hypothesis (H0). Therefore, we conclude that the length of stay cannot be predicted from the independent variables (AGE, FEMALE and RACE) used in this model. This suggests that other variables or factors not considered in this analysis may be more related to the length of hospital stay. It is important to explore other possible variables or approaches to better understand the determinants of length of stay and provide a more accurate prediction.

Question 7: To analyze the relationship between the total cost of health care (TOTCHG) and the independent variables (AGE, FEMALE, LOS, RACE and APRDRG), we will use a Linear Regression model. The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that there is a significant linear relationship. When carrying out the analysis, we can observe that, in the previous models, the variables AGE, LOS and APRDRG were identified as the most relevant to explain and predict expenses with hospitalizations.This tells us that the patient's age, length of stay in the hospital, and refined diagnostic group are key factors that influence health care costs. These three variables demonstrate a significant relationship with the total cost of hospital admissions.

It is important to highlight that, although the variable FEMALE and the variable RACE were also included in the model, they were not significant in explaining the expenses with hospitalizations.Therefore, based on previous analyses, we can conclude that patient age, length of hospital stay and refined diagnosis group (APRDRG) are the most relevant and significant variables to explain and predict the costs associated with hospital admissions. This reinforces the importance of considering these factors when assessing and planning resource allocation and financial management in healthcare institutions.
